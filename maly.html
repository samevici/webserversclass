        <p> Maly is the first cat I fostered with a shelter (Juniper was an informal foster)
            He arrived to the shelter declawed and has behaviour problems because of it. He is giant
            Thankfully a nice man decided to give him a chance and he is now happily adopted. 
            He is even doing well enough to allow his new dad to put him in a hot dog costume! 
            Unfortunately I lost the picture ....</p>
