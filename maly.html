        <p> Maly is a beautiful cat with a fascinating face. He is also very large.</p>
        <p> Maly arrived to our foster declawed, and this practice often causes behaviour issues in cats, because they are in constant pain. </p>
        <p> Maly is therefore more distrustful and reactive than most cats. He hates other cats, and would not be good with kids. In a calm environment however, he is able to thrive.</p>
        <p> When he is happy, he allows his human to pet his stomach, which is a great honour! He is not a cuddler, but he loves to sleep at your feet</p>
        <p> He has no known medical problems besides his declawing. Since he is an adult, his adoptions fees are 200$</p>
