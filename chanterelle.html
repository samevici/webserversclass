        <p> Chanterelle is a friendly and curious cat -- but with strict boundaries! When we first found her, she was aggressive towards cats, and scary even to humans.</p>
        <p> However, after giving her (cat-dosage) prozac, she was able to calm down, and her tolerance for petting has increased over the time she spent in foster family.</p>
        <p> With her raspy voice and slightly spicy tendencies, we are convinced she is a demon from hell, but nevertheless we love her.</p>
        <p> Once we learned the exact way to pet her, and we figured out how to get her into a carrier without restraining her, we did not have any problems with her anymore!</p>
        <p> She will need to take her antidepressants all her life, as she seems to be an inherently stressed cat. Since she is an adult, her adoptions fees are 200$</p>
