        <p> Kasha was adopted in fall of 2020. 
            My sister and I used to live together and when we saw mice in the apartment we thought it is time to realise our dreams of cat adoption
            Kasha means porridge in Russian
            When my sister moved out, she took Kasha in the divorce </p>
