        <p> Kasha was initially a shy cat, but after some time in a foster family, she opened up and now lives for attention</p>
        <p> She is no longer very active. She loves lazing in the sun and asking for back scratches.</p> 
        <p> In a year or two she will be a respected senior</p>
        <p> She has a small heart murmur and will need veterinary follow up for it. Since she is an adult, her adoptions fees are 200$</p>
